    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make oven-roasted asparagus, begin by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). Wash the asparagus spears and trim off the tough ends. Place the asparagus on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, ensuring each spear is lightly coated. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and any additional desired seasonings such as garlic powder or grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <p>Next, spread the asparagus out in a single layer on the baking sheet to ensure even cooking. Roast in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the spears are tender and lightly browned. Serve the oven-roasted asparagus hot as a delicious and nutritious side dish, perfect for pairing with a variety of main courses.</p>
