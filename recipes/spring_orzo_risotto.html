    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spring Orzo Risotto is a delightful twist on the classic Italian dish, using orzo pasta instead of traditional Arborio rice. To start, sauté finely chopped shallots and garlic in olive oil until fragrant and translucent. Then, add fresh asparagus spears, English peas, and thinly sliced carrots to the skillet, allowing them to cook briefly until they are just tender-crisp. Incorporate the orzo pasta into the mixture, toasting it slightly to enhance its nutty flavor before gradually adding vegetable broth, stirring continuously until the orzo is creamy and al dente. Finish the dish with a touch of lemon zest, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped fresh herbs like parsley and chives for a burst of springtime freshness.</p>
    <p>This Spring Orzo Risotto is a vibrant and flavorful dish that celebrates the bounty of the season. With its tender orzo grains enveloped in a creamy sauce and studded with tender vegetables, it's a satisfying meal that's both comforting and light. Serve it as a main course or as a side dish alongside grilled chicken or fish for a delightful springtime feast that's sure to impress.</p>
